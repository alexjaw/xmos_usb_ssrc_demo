   Sample Rate Conversion Library |version|

Overview
--------

The XMOS Sample Rate Conversion (SRC) library provides both synchronous and asynchronous audio sample rate conversion functions for use on xCORE-200 multicore micro-controllers.

In systems where the rate change is exactly equal to the ratio of nominal rates, synchronous sample rate conversion (SSRC) provides efficient and high performance rate conversion. Where the input and output rates are not locked by a common clock or clocked by an exact rational frequency ratio, the Asynchronous Sample Rate Converter (ASRC) provides a way of streaming high quality audio between the two different clock domains, at the cost of higher processing resource usage. ASRC can ease interfacing in cases where the are multiple digital audio inputs or allow cost saving by removing the need for physical clock recovery using a PLL.

  * - configuration: SSRC
    - target: XCORE-200-EXPLORER
    - globals: int in_buff[4]; int out_buff[20]; ssrc_state_t sSSRCState[2]; int iSSRCStack[2][32]; ssrc_ctrl_t sSSRCCtrl[2];

    - fn: unsafe{ssrc_init(0, 0, sSSRCCtrl, 2, 4, 0);ssrc_process(in_buff, out_buff, sSSRCCtrl);}

The SSRC algorithm runs a series of cascaded FIR filters to perform the rate conversion. This includes interpolation, decimation and bandwidth limiting filters with a final polyphase FIR filter. The last stage supports the rational rate change of 147:160 or 160:147 allowing conversion between 44.1KHz family of sample rates to the 48KHz family of sample rates.

.. tip::
  The below table shows the worst case MHz consumption at a given sample rate using the minimum block size of 4 input samples with dithering disabled. The MHz requirement can be reduced by around 8-12%, depending on sample rate, by increasing the input block size to 16. It is not usefully reduced by increasing block size beyond 16.

.. resusage::

  * - configuration: ASRC
    - target: XCORE-200-EXPLORER
    - globals: int in_buff[4]; int out_buff[20]; asrc_ctrl_t sASRCCtrl[2]; asrc_adfir_coefs_t SiASRCADFIRCoefs; asrc_state_t sASRCState[2]; int asrc_stack[2][32];

    - fn: unsafe{asrc_init(0, 0, sASRCCtrl, 2, 4, 0); asrc_process(in_buff, out_buff, 0, sASRCCtrl);}

The ASRC algorithm also runs a series of cascaded FIR filters to perform the rate conversion. The final filter is different because it uses adaptive coefficients to handle the varying rate change between the input and the output. The adaptive coefficients must be computed for each output sample period, but can be shared amongst all channels within the ASRC instance. Consequently, the MHz usage of the ASRC is expressed as two tables; the first table enumerates the MHz required for the first channel with adaptive coefficients calculation and the second table specifies the MHz required for filtering of each additional channel processed by the ASRC instance.

.. tip::
  The below tables show the worst case MHz consumption per sample, using the minimum block size of 4 input samples. The MHz requirement can be reduced by around 8-12% by increasing the input block size to 16.

.. tip::
  Typically you will need to allow for performance headroom for buffering (especially if the system is sample orientated rather than block orientated) and inter-task communication. Please refer to the application notes for practical examples of usage.

.. caution:: Configurations requiring more than 100MHz cannot currently be run in real time on a single core. The performance limit for a single core on a 500MHz xCORE-200 device is 100MHz (500/5). Further optimization of the library, including assembler optimization and pipelining of the adaptive filter generation and FIR filter stages, is feasible to achieve higher sample rate operation within the constraints of a 100MHz logical core.
